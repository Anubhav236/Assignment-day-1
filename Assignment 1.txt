1. Compiler: 
It is a translator which takes input i.e., High-Level Language, and produces an output of low-level language i.e. machine or assembly language. 
•	A compiler is more intelligent than an assembler it checks all kinds of limits, ranges, errors, etc.
•	But its program run time is more and occupies a larger part of memory. It has slow speed because a compiler goes through the entire program and then translates the entire program into machine codes.

2. Interpreter: 
An interpreter is a program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language. –  
•	It translates only one statement of the program at a time.
•	Interpreters, more often than not are smaller than compilers. 


CODE:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        int roll;
        String name;
        float marks;
        
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	System.out.print("roll is : ");
        roll = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("roll is : = " + roll);
        System.out.print("Enter Name: ");
        name = sc.next();
        System.out.println("Name: = " + name);
    	System.out.print("Enter marks: ");
        marks = sc.nextFloat();
        System.out.println("Marks obtained : = " + marks);
    }
}
